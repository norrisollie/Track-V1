# Track

A project I worked on as part of a group for the Advanced Web Technologies unit in my third year at Ravensbourne.

We had to use more than two or more APIs to create a small web application.

For the unit, we created and application called "Track".

Track works by finding the user locations, finding five stations closest to you and then displaying the timetables for each station.

It uses the HTML 5 Geolocation API to find the user's coordinates.

It uses an API from [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/data/api/transport) to get the coordinates for every mainline station in the UK to be able to determine the stations closest to the user

It then uses the [TransportAPI](transportapi.com) API to fetch timetable information for the relevant stations.
